A website and an API made for tourism, based on Wikipedia information.

## Features

## Resources used

The application uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org) tiles as well as [Leaflet Routing Machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) to guide users.
Some icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) were compiled using [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).
