# WikiJourney (web)
Wikijourney is a collection of services - a [website](http://wikijourney.eu), and an Android applicaton - that aims to promote free (as in a speech) tourism.<br />
The website's main purpose is to locate the user, display points of interest around him and allow him to create an itinerary made from these POIs; in this repository you'll find the website's entire source code.

It uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) displaying [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org) tiles, and [Leaflet Routing Machine](http://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/) for the direction part.
