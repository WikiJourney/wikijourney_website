//===> about.php
define("_ABOUT_TITLE", 		"Tell me more about WikiJourney");
define("_ABOUT_TEXT","		<p>It's a student project, which was made to connect a user and Wikimedia content, linked by its position in a city.<br/>
							We are trying to release a mobile app which will recommend to tourists some points of interest to visit. Adjust your settings, chose a path, and let's go!
							</p>
							<h2>Why an application?</h2>
							<p>
							Because it's the more portative way, and the simplest when we talk about tourism. When you're walking in a city, you'd rather take a quick look at your phone than using your laptop, aren't you?
							<br/>It will also be possible to prepare ones trip before, on a computer. Data will be viewable thanks to an offline mode.
							</p>
							<h2>WanderWiki is back! </h2>
							<p>
							You already knew about <a href=\"http://wiki-geolocalisation.wix.com/\">WanderWiki</a>? Great! WikiJourney is the pursuit of this project. We are trying to make
							it more powerful, with new functionalities.</p>

							<h2>Questions, Proposals...?</h2>
							<p>We are listening to anyone! Contribute on our Git, or <a href=\"mailto:wikijourneydev@gmail.com\">send us a mail</a>!<br/>
							Or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.wikijourney.wikijourney\">test the app</a> !</p>");
